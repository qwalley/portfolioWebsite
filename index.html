				The TODO app was a quick project that I started to introduce myself to mobile development using React Native. I used the managed workflow in expo_cli so that I could develop on my desktop PC while still testing on my iPhone. Since this is a simple, offline app I chose to use SQLite as a database.
			</p>
			<p>
				The app offers three different lists: the "One-Off Tasks" for unusual or infrequent tasks, and the Daily and Weekly lists for recurring tasks. These two lists will reset completed tasks at the end of every day/week.
			</p>
			<p>
				Adding and removing tasks is done using the buttons at the start of each list.
				Users can record completed tasks by tapping on a list item, and checks can be removed by pressing and holding a line item. Navigating between lists is done by swiping left or right.

				For our capstone project, three friends and I decided to see if we could use the LEAP Motion sensor to build a virtual working environment that would allow people to use their computers with a VR headset instead of a monitor and keyboard. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Leap Motion sensor is a product that attaches to a VR headset and captures positional data about the user's hands. This data is made available to developers through the LEAP SDK, which renders a set of hands into Unity that can interact with other game objects. 
			</p>
			<p>
				While our keyboard suceeded in allowing equivalent typing speeds to the keyboards that rely the Vive's controllers, we wouldn't want to write an essay with it!
